# pizza-price-prediction

- From a given dataset which we use as training sets given some pizza diameters and their respective prices.
- taking diameter as a feature we fitted a Linear Regression model based on single feature(Diameter). 
- we need to predict the price for given input size of pizza from the fitted model.
- The file named as SimpleRegPizzaPrice.py Regresses simple linear Regression on Diameter of pizza given to the Price of pizza in dollars.
- The file named as Simple_and_polyreg_compare.py compares the Simple and Polynomial(degree=2) regression on Diameter of Pizza given to the Price of pizza in dollers.
